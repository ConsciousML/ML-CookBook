# My Machine Learning Cook Book

## Goal
This repository aims to compile a selection of the most important machine learning concepts.<br/>
The document regrouping this knowledge is not intended to be used to by-pass the reading of serious machine learning books.<br/>
This document should be used as a reminder for the reader to keep in mind the basic mathematical tools to understand and implement most machine learning algorithms.

## Document
My Machine Learning Cook Book can be found as a pdf file at the root of the project.
